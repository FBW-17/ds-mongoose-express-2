# Mongoose - Exercise 3

## Implement all CRUD operations in Mongoose

Now instead of just returning dummy responses, we actually want to perform real operations on our MongoDB when our routes are called

* Implement the Mongoose operations for /GET, /POST, /PATCH, /DELETE
    * Fetch all users from the MongoDB
    * Fetch a single user from the MongoDB
    * Create / POST a new user to MongoDB
    * Update an existing user in MongoDB
    * Delete an existing user in MongoDB 

* Return the fetched / created / updated / deleted record as JSON to the browser

* Test the routes again with your fetch statements in the Browser console

* Check in Compass or the mongo shell, if all your operations were successfully performed to the database. If not: Please adapt your code until it works

WELL DONE! 
Our technology stack is now complete. We can now write modern fullstack applications.
